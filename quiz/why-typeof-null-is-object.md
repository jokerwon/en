**Interviewer**: So, can you explain why the result of `typeof null` is "object"?
**Interviewee**: It's a legacy issue in JavaScript. In the early days of JavaScript, variables were represented using 32 - bit values. The first 3 bits of these values indicated the type. For example, 000 was for objects, 010 for floating - point numbers, 100 for strings, and 110 for Boolean values. Other values were treated as pointers. Now, `null` was seen as an all - zero pointer, which was considered an empty object reference. That's why `typeof null` returns "object".

**Interviewer**: Since it's a legacy issue, why can't it be fixed?
**Interviewee**: Well, over time, a lot of code has been written assuming that `typeof null` returns "object". Changing this behavior would break a large amount of existing code. So, for the sake of backward compatibility, it has remained as part of the language. That's why when we want to check if a variable is `null`, it's recommended to use the strict equality operator (`===`).

------

**Interviewer**: Give me an example of how using `typeof null` can be misleading and why we should use `===` instead.
**Interviewee**: Let's say we have a function that is supposed to handle `null` values specifically. If we use `typeof` to check, like this:

```javascript
function handleValue(value) {
    if (typeof value === 'object') {
        // This will wrongly consider null as an object
        console.log('It seems like an object');
    }
}
handleValue(null);
```

Here, the function will print the message even though `null` might not be what we really want to handle as an object. But if we use `===`:

```javascript
function handleValue(value) {
    if (value === null) {
        console.log('It is null');
    }
}
handleValue(null);
```

This gives us the correct and more precise check, avoiding the misclassification due to the `typeof null` legacy issue.
