**Interviewer**: Let's talk about equality comparison in JavaScript. Can you explain the difference between the `==` and `===` operators?

**Candidate**: Of course. The key difference is that `==` is the loose equality operator that performs type coercion, while `===` is the strict equality operator that doesn't perform type coercion. With `===`, both values must be of the same type and have the same value to return `true`.

------

**Interviewer**: That's right. Could you walk me through the algorithm that JavaScript follows when comparing values using the `==` operator?

**Candidate**: Sure! When using the `==` operator, JavaScript follows a specific algorithm for type coercion:
1. First, it checks if both operands are of the **same type**. If they are, it simply compares their values directly, just like `===` would.
2. If the types differ, JavaScript starts a series of type conversions.
3. One of the first special cases it checks is whether one value is **`null`** and the other is **`undefined`**. If so, it returns true immediately. This is why `null == undefined` evaluates to `true`.
4. If one operand is a **string** and the other is a **number**, the string gets converted to a number before comparison. For example, `"5" == 5` is true because `"5"` is converted to the number `5`.
5. If one operand is a **boolean**, it gets converted to a number (`false` becomes `0`, `true` becomes `1`) before the comparison. So `true == 1` is `true`, and `false == 0` is `true`.
6. If one operand is an **object** and the other is a **primitive type** (string, number, or symbol), the object is converted to its primitive value using either valueOf() or toString() methods. For instance, `[1] == 1` is `true` because `[1]` is converted to `"1"` and then to `1`.

------

**Interviewer**: Excellent explanation. Can you give me an example of a comparison that might surprise developers who aren't familiar with these coercion rules?

**Candidate**: There are several tricky examples! One classic example is:

```js
[] == false  // true
```

This evaluates to true because:

1. The empty array is an object, so it gets converted to its primitive form, which is an empty string `""`
2. The empty string is then converted to a number, which is `0`
3. `false` is converted to the number `0`
4. `0 == 0` is `true`

Another surprising example is:

```js
"" == 0       // true
"0" == false  // true
null == undefined  // true
```

These unexpected results are why many style guides recommend always using `===` for equality comparisons unless you specifically need type coercion.

------

**Interviewer**: That's a great point. In your experience, when would you intentionally use `==` instead of `===`?

**Candidate**: I generally prefer `===` for clarity and to avoid unexpected behavior. However, there are a few legitimate use cases for `==`:

1. When checking if a variable is either `null` or `undefined`, you can use `variable == null` instead of `variable === null || variable === undefined`.
2. When working with APIs or systems where you don't control the type of the returned values, but you know the semantic meaning. For example, if an API might return either the string `"1"` or the number `1` to represent the same thing.
3. In rare performance-critical code where the slight performance advantage of `==` might matter (though this is rarely a significant factor in modern JavaScript engines).

That said, I believe code clarity is usually more important than these minor advantages, so I typically default to `===` unless there's a specific reason not to.

------

**Interviewer**: Very thorough answer! You clearly understand JavaScript's type coercion mechanisms well.
