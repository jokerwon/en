**Interviewer**: Hey, could you start by comparing the two ways of asynchronously loading JS scripts you mentioned?
**Interviewee**: Sure. The first way, creating a `<script>` tag dynamically, is relatively straightforward. You just create the tag, set the `src` to the script's URL, and use events like `onload` to know when it's done. It's a native and simple approach that browsers handle well. However, it might be a bit limited in terms of customizing the loading process.

The second way, using `XMLHttpRequest` or `Fetch API`, gives more control. You can handle the request and response more precisely. For example, with `XMLHttpRequest`, you can set headers, handle different response states, etc. But then you have to parse the response text into JavaScript code and use `eval()` or `Function()` constructor to execute it. Using `eval()` can be risky as it can execute any code in the global scope, potentially leading to security issues.

**Interviewer**: How does asynchronous loading improve page loading speed and response performance compared to synchronous loading?
**Interviewee**: With synchronous loading, the browser has to stop everything and wait for the script to load and execute before moving on to other tasks like rendering the page or loading other resources. This can cause the page to seem stuck. But asynchronous loading allows the browser to keep doing other things while the script is being fetched in the background. So, other parts of the page can start loading and rendering right away, which makes the overall page loading feel much faster. Also, if there are multiple scripts, asynchronous loading can overlap their loading times, reducing the total time needed to load all the scripts.

**Interviewer**: Can you give an example of how asynchronous loading helps in controlling the loading sequence and execution time of scripts?
**Interviewee**: Let's say you have a web page that has some core functionality scripts and some optional feature scripts. You can load the core scripts first asynchronously. Once they are loaded and the basic page structure is set up, you can then decide based on user actions or other conditions whether to load the optional scripts. For instance, if you have a photo-editing web app, the main editing functionality scripts can be loaded first. Then, if the user clicks a button to use a special filter, you can asynchronously load the script for that filter at that moment. This way, you're not loading unnecessary scripts upfront, and you have full control over when different scripts are loaded and executed, improving the page's maintainability and user experience.

------

**Interviewer**: What are the potential security risks when using the `eval()` function in the second asynchronous loading method?
**Interviewee**: When you use `eval()` to execute the JavaScript code fetched via `XMLHttpRequest` or `Fetch API`, if an attacker manages to manipulate the script source (for example, by intercepting the network request), they can inject malicious code. Since `eval()` executes code in the global scope, this malicious code can potentially access and modify sensitive data, perform unauthorized actions like stealing user credentials, or change the behavior of the entire application. It bypasses many of the normal security mechanisms that modern browsers have in place to protect the execution environment, making the application vulnerable to attacks.
