**Interviewer**: Hey, could you tell me how to merge objects in JavaScript?
**Interviewee**: Sure, there are two common ways. One is by using `Object.assign()`. For example, if you have `const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 };` and `const obj2 = { c: 3, d: 4 };`, you can do `const mergedObj = Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2);` The first argument `{}` is an empty object where the merged properties will be added. This will give you `{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }`. The other way is by using the spread operator `...`. With the same `obj1` and `obj2`, you can do `const mergedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };` which also results in `{ a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4 }`. But keep in mind, if the objects have properties with the same name, the value of the later property will overwrite the earlier one.

**Interviewer**: What are the differences between using `Object.assign()` and the spread operator for merging objects?
**Interviewee**: Well, in terms of the basic functionality of merging properties, they seem quite similar. However, there are some subtle differences. `Object.assign()` mutates the target object (the first argument). So, if you pass an existing non-empty object as the first argument, it will be modified. For example, if you do `const target = { e: 5 }; Object.assign(target, obj1, obj2);`, `target` itself will be changed. On the other hand, the spread operator creates a new object. It's more of an immutable operation. Also, the spread operator is a bit more concise and has a more modern, ES6-style syntax. It's often preferred in functional programming-style code where immutability is important.

**Interviewer**: Suppose you have nested objects and you want to merge them. How do these two methods fare?
**Interviewee**: When dealing with nested objects, both `Object.assign()` and the spread operator have limitations. With `Object.assign()`, it only does a shallow merge. So, if you have nested objects like `const obj1 = { a: { x: 1 } }; const obj2 = { a: { y: 2 } };`, `Object.assign({}, obj1, obj2)` will result in `{ a: { y: 2 } }`. The inner object from `obj2` overwrites the one from `obj1` completely. The spread operator also does a shallow merge. So, for the same example, `{ ...obj1, ...obj2 }` will give the same result. To do a deep merge for nested objects, you'd need to write custom functions or use libraries like `lodash` which has a `merge` function that can handle deep merging more gracefully.

**Interviewer**: In a performance-critical application, which method would you choose for merging simple objects?
**Interviewee**: For simple objects, the spread operator is generally a good choice. It's not only more concise but also in modern JavaScript engines, it can be quite performant. Since it creates a new object directly, there's no need for the extra function call overhead like in `Object.assign()`. However, if you need to support older browsers that don't support the spread operator well, then `Object.assign()` would be the fallback option. But if the application is targeting modern browsers and performance is key, the spread operator is a better bet for simple object merging.
