**Interviewer**: Hi there! Today I'd like to discuss some fundamental concepts in JavaScript. Could you tell me about the differences between null and undefined?

**Candidate**: Sure! Both null and undefined are primitive data types in JavaScript, but they have several key differences. Undefined means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value, while null represents an "empty object pointer" and is typically used to initialize variables that are expected to later hold an object.

------

**Interviewer**: Can you give me an example of when undefined would occur?

**Candidate**: Of course. When we declare a variable without assigning a value, it defaults to undefined:

```javascript
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
```

Also, when a function doesn't return anything, it implicitly returns undefined.

------

**Interviewer**: Good. In what situations would you typically use null?

**Candidate**: Null is typically used when we want to explicitly indicate "no value" or "empty value". For example, when initializing a variable that will eventually point to an object, but doesn't have one yet:

```javascript
let user = null; // user data not loaded yet
```

------

**Interviewer**: Interestingly, what do these two types return when using the typeof operator?

**Candidate**: That's a great question. typeof undefined returns "undefined", which makes sense. But interestingly, typeof null returns "object", which is actually a historical bug in JavaScript that was never fixed for compatibility reasons.

**Interviewer**: Is there anything to be aware of when comparing these two values?

**Candidate**: Yes, when comparing null and undefined using the double equals operator (==), it returns true because double equals performs type conversion:

```javascript
console.log(null == undefined); // true
```

But when using triple equals (===), which compares both value and type, it returns false:

```javascript
console.log(null === undefined); // false
```

------

**Interviewer**: You mentioned undefined is not a reserved word. What implications does this have?

**Candidate**: Since undefined is not a reserved word, theoretically it can be reassigned, which might cause unexpected behavior in code:

```javascript
let undefined = 'new value';
```

This would throw an error in strict mode, but is allowed in non-strict mode. To safely get the undefined value, we can use void 0, which always returns undefined:

```javascript
let safeUndefined = void 0;
```

------

**Interviewer**: Very comprehensive answer! One last question: can you briefly explain why we need these two different "empty value" concepts?

**Candidate**: That's a great question. The reason for having both is mainly to express different semantics: undefined represents a "not yet assigned" state, it's a system-level, default empty value; while null represents an "intentionally missing value", actively set by the programmer. This distinction makes code intentions clearer and helps us understand why a variable is empty.

**Interviewer**: Excellent explanation, thank you for your answer!
