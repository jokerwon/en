**Interviewer**: Alright, let's talk about the differences among Ajax, axios, and fetch. First, could you briefly explain what Ajax is?

**Interviewee**: Ajax stands for "Asynchronous JavaScript and XML." It allows web pages to be interactive without reloading the entire page. It fetches data from the server in the background to update parts of the page. But it has some drawbacks. It's more suitable for MVC programming, not really in line with the current front - end MVVM trend. It's based on the native XHR with an unclear architecture, doesn't follow the Separation of Concerns principle well, and its setup and calling methods are messy. Also, its event - based async model isn't very user - friendly.

**Interviewer**: Got it. Now, what about fetch? How is it different from Ajax?

**Interviewee**: Fetch is like a replacement for Ajax, introduced with ES6 and using promise objects. Its code structure is much simpler because of the use of promises. It's native JavaScript and doesn't use XMLHttpRequest objects. Fetch has a straightforward and more semantic syntax, is built on the standard Promise, so it supports async/await. It also has a rich set of APIs for requests and responses. However, it has some downsides. It only throws errors for network issues, considering 400s and 500s as successes. By default, it doesn't carry cookies, and you need to set `credentials: 'include'` to make it do so. It lacks support for aborting requests or controlling timeouts, and it can't natively track request progress like XHR.

**Interviewer**: Good. And how does axios fit into this picture? What are its differences compared to the other two?

**Interviewee**: Axios is a Promise - based HTTP client. It can launch XMLHttpRequests from browsers and handle HTTP requests in Node.js. It supports the Promise API, can track requests and responses, transform them, cancel requests, automatically handle JSON data, and on the client - side, it can guard against XSRF attacks. Compared to Ajax, it has a more modern and organized approach with better support for promises. Compared to fetch, it has features like built - in support for aborting requests, controlling timeouts, and handling cookies without extra configuration, and it can track request progress, which fetch can't do natively.

**Interviewer**: Suppose you are building a new front - end application. Under what circumstances would you choose one over the other?

**Interviewee**: If the application is following an older MVC pattern and there are legacy code dependencies, Ajax might be a consideration, but it's not ideal. For a modern ES6 - based front - end application where simplicity and using native JavaScript features are important, and you don't mind handling some limitations like lack of timeout control, fetch could be a good choice. However, if the application requires more advanced features like easy cancellation of requests, handling XSRF protection, and better support for both browser and Node.js environments, axios would be the better option. For example, in a single - page application where security and handling various HTTP - related operations gracefully are crucial, axios would be a top pick.
