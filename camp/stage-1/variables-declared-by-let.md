**Interviewer**: Hey, can you tell me if variables globally declared with 'let' can be accessed via the window object?

**Interviewee**: No, they can't. Variables declared with 'let' aren't attached to the global 'window' object. So, you can't access them using 'window.variablename'. It's different from variables declared with 'var'. Variables declared with 'var' get mounted on the global object, and you can access them like 'window.variableName'. For instance, if you have 'let foo = 'bar'; var baz = 'qux';', when you do 'console.log(window.foo);' it will show 'undefined', but 'console.log(window.baz);' will show 'qux'.

**Interviewer**: Why is it that variables declared with 'let' don't get attached to the window object?

**Interviewee**: The main reason is to create more scoped based variable handling. 'let' was introduced to have block-scoped variables. Attaching them to the window object would defeat the purpose of having this more restricted scope. If 'let' variables were on the window object, it would be easier to accidentally create naming conflicts globally, and the code would be less modular and harder to manage. By not being on the window object, 'let' variables are more self-contained within their defined scopes, like inside a block or a function, which makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.

**Interviewer**: Can you think of a scenario where this difference between 'let' and 'var' in terms of window object attachment could cause issues in a large-scale project?

**Interviewee**: In a large-scale project, if developers are used to the old way of using 'var' and expect variables to be globally accessible via the window object. Suppose there's a team working on different parts of the codebase. One developer uses 'let' to declare a variable thinking it's just a normal variable declaration, but another developer, assuming all variables are on the window object (from old 'var' habits), tries to access it via the window object. This could lead to bugs where the variable seems 'undefined' when accessed in an unexpected way. Also, in a modular codebase, if there are many files with 'let' variables, and some code in a different module wrongly assumes it can access these 'let' variables via the window object, it can break the modularity and cause hard to find bugs.
